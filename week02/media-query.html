            <h2>2 Nephi 4:34-35</h2>
            <p>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of
                flesh; for I
                know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his
                trust in man or
                maketh flesh his arm.
                Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not
                amiss; therefore
                I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness.
                Behold, my voice
                shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</p>
